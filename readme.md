# Tweetor

Tweetor is a pure multi module angular app which aims at make high frequent tweets observable.

We used folling components besides common stuff like angular, require.js and d3 jquery:

* [angular debounce](https://github.com/rubenv/angular-debounce)
* [ngTagsInput](http://mbenford.github.io/ngTagsInput)
* [ngModal](https://github.com/adamalbrecht/ngModal)

This project was part of on of my study works.
